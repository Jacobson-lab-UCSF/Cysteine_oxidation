# Analysis of Cysteines

## Finding Neighbors in the PDB

Analysis of the changing enviroment of cysteines according to their oxidation state.

The analysis of neighbors contains the  following jupyther notebooks:

- [JPN1: Extraction of neighbors around the cysteine residue](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/blob/main/Jupyther_notebooks/Cysteins_enviroments_counting.ipynb)

- [JPN2: Counting number of residues extracted with JPN1](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/blob/main/Jupyther_notebooks/Extract_numbersFromEnviromentsOutFiles.ipynb)

- [JPN3: Plotting the results as networks](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/blob/main/Jupyther_notebooks/Plotting_SGneighbors_asNetworks.ipynb)

Examples of input files and output files are found in the [folder of examples](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/tree/main/examples_inputfiles)

The final summary of data is found in the [folder of excel files](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/tree/main/summaryFiles_xlsx)

## SASA calculation 

Calculating of SASA (Solvent Accesible Surface Area) according to the oxidation state of the cysteines. 

The analysis can be found in the following notebook:

- [JPN4: SASA calculation](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/blob/main/Jupyther_notebooks/SASA_examples.ipynb)

And the final summary of SASA values are in the files named CYS_SASA_relative.txt in the [folder of examples](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/tree/main/examples_inputfiles)
